## Evan's Portfolio

### Overview

Hi! I'm an aspiring data scientist looking to forward my career. I just graduated from the University of Maryland in May, 2024 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Physics. I passionate about extracting useful trends from data and learning new Computer Vision and NLP research. I'm currently performing DS & front-end software engineering at NAVAIR to help Navy personnel remain safe and informed day-to-day, and am excited to add Flask and CICD methedologies to my toolbox.

I built this [github page](https://evanshaped.github.io/) as a portfolio for my work and progress as a data scientist. I want to display my skills and interests efficiently and aesthetically. As I'm in the early stages of creating this portfolio, much of my work is missing and/or needs refinement, but please look around at what I do have so far!
